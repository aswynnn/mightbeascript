Might Be A Script is a cross-platform screenwriting app (Windows, macOS, iPadOS) designed around a clean, Apple-style writing experience. It features a structured screenplay editor with automatic INT./EXT. scene handling, a left sidebar for scene navigation, and a floating bottom-center formatting toolbar inspired by Figma and Apple Freeform. Each scene supports a swipe-in storyboard panel with pen, eraser, color, and size controls for quick visual planning. Scripts are block-based, Fountain-compatible, saved locally first, and securely synced to per-user cloud storage with proper permissions. The focus is minimal UI, zero clutter, offline reliability, and a calm, aesthetically pleasing workflow for writers.
